The self-driving vehicle will need to create a path on a 2D-grid that contains a starting point (x,y), a delivery point (x,y) and a number of obstacles. Your vehicle can navigate to any of the adjacent squares (even diagonally), as long as the squares are inbound and do not contain an obstacle.
Phase 1:Implement a 10x10 grid that contains a starting point on (0,0), the delivery point on (9,9) and the following obstacles on locations (9,7) (8,7) (6,7) (6,8).Your algorithm should calculate a valid path avoiding the obstacles and reaching the delivery point.Your solution should print the path in the format of [(x1,y2), (x2,y2)...] and also the number of steps.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97548017/174972351-5dd31aa6-f78e-4336-a63c-5598644eba27.png)

Phase 2:Add an additional 20 randomly placed obstacles and print their location using the format [(x1,y1),(x2,y2)...]. The obstacles should not overlap existing ones and should not be places at the start and delivery points... Your algorithm should calculate a valid path avoiding the obstacles and reaching the delivery point.Your solution should print the path in the format of [(x1,y2), (x2,y2)...)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97548017/174972421-11c292d9-98dc-4ef9-864e-224b0bf33afe.png)
